# Search Skills

## Overview

This room introduced how to efficiently search the internet and use specialised tools and technical documentation to find information relevant to cyber security.

Topics explored included:
- Effective internet searching
- Shodan for scanning internet-connected devices
- VirusTotal for analysing suspicious files and URLs
- Vulnerability databases and CVEs
- Reading technical documentation and man pages
- Using GitHub for security research

## Key Concepts Learned

Being able to find accurate, relevant information quickly is one of the most practical skills in cyber security. This room introduced a range of tools and resources that security professionals use daily for research, reconnaissance, and threat analysis.

## Effective Searching

Not all searches are equal. Knowing how to construct precise queries saves time and surfaces more useful results.

Useful techniques include:
- Using quotation marks to search for exact phrases
- Using site: to restrict results to a specific domain
- Using filetype: to find specific document types
- Combining terms to narrow results
- Using Google dorking to find exposed or sensitive information

Strong search skills support reconnaissance, vulnerability research, and learning.

## Shodan

Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices. Unlike Google, which indexes web pages, Shodan scans the internet and indexes information about devices such as servers, cameras, routers, and industrial systems.

Security professionals use Shodan to:
- Discover exposed services and open ports
- Identify devices running outdated or vulnerable software
- Research the attack surface of an organisation
- Find misconfigured systems that should not be publicly accessible

Shodan is a powerful reconnaissance tool used by both attackers and defenders.

## VirusTotal

VirusTotal is an online service that analyses files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses using dozens of antivirus engines and security tools simultaneously.

Security professionals use VirusTotal to:
- Check whether a file is known malware
- Analyse suspicious URLs or domains
- Investigate IP addresses associated with threats
- Look up file hashes to check against known threat databases

VirusTotal is commonly used during incident response and threat intelligence workflows.

## Vulnerability Databases and CVEs

A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardised identifier assigned to a publicly known security vulnerability.

Key resources include:
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database) — a comprehensive database of CVEs with severity scores
- CVE Details — a searchable interface for browsing vulnerability data
- Exploit-DB — a database of known exploits for identified vulnerabilities

Security professionals use these databases to:
- Research vulnerabilities in software they are testing or defending
- Assess the severity and potential impact of a vulnerability
- Find proof-of-concept exploits for known issues
- Stay informed about newly disclosed vulnerabilities

## Technical Documentation and Man Pages

Man pages (manual pages) are the built-in documentation for command-line tools on Linux and Unix systems.

Using man pages effectively allows security professionals to:
- Understand all available options for a tool
- Use unfamiliar commands confidently
- Avoid relying on third-party sources for command syntax

Example:
Running `man nmap` displays the full documentation for the Nmap tool, including every flag and option available.

Reading official technical documentation is always preferable to relying on informal guides when accuracy matters.

## GitHub

GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code. It is widely used in cyber security for accessing and sharing tools, scripts, and research.

Security professionals use GitHub to:
- Find open-source security tools and frameworks
- Access proof-of-concept exploit code for research purposes
- Look up configuration files and scripts related to a target technology
- Contribute to and benefit from the security community

GitHub can also be a source of accidentally exposed sensitive information, such as hardcoded credentials or API keys, making it a useful reconnaissance resource.

## Why This Matters

The ability to find information quickly and accurately is foundational to almost every cyber security role.

Search skills are used in:
- Reconnaissance and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Vulnerability research and analysis
- Incident response and threat intelligence
- Tool discovery and learning

Being able to use the right resource for the right question makes a security professional significantly more effective.

## Reflection

This room demonstrated that cyber security is not just about technical skills — knowing where and how to find information is equally important. Tools like Shodan, VirusTotal, and CVE databases, combined with strong search habits, give security professionals a significant advantage in both offensive and defensive contexts.
