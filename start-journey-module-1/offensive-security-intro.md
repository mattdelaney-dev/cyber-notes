# Offensive Security Intro

## Overview

This room provided a hands-on introduction to offensive security by hacking a website legally in a safe, simulated environment.

Topics explored included:
- Thinking like a hacker
- Finding hidden pages on a web application
- Attacking an admin page
- The role and mindset of an ethical hacker

## Key Concepts Learned

Offensive security means attacking systems and applications — with permission — to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do. This room demonstrated that mindset through a practical, guided exercise.

## Thinking Like a Hacker

Offensive security starts with a shift in mindset. Rather than asking "how do I protect this?", the question becomes "how would I break this?"

This involves:
- Looking for things that are hidden or unintended
- Questioning assumptions about how an application works
- Identifying what an attacker might target
- Trying inputs and paths that a developer may not have considered

This mindset is what separates a proactive security professional from a purely reactive one.

## Finding Hidden Pages

Web applications often have pages or directories that are not linked anywhere on the site but still exist on the server. These hidden pages can be discovered through a technique called directory enumeration.

Tools like Gobuster can automatically try common directory and file names against a web server to find pages that are not meant to be publicly accessible.

Hidden pages can include:
- Admin panels
- Backup files
- Configuration pages
- Login portals

Finding these pages is often one of the first steps in assessing a web application's security.

## Attacking the Admin Page

Once a hidden admin page is discovered, an attacker may attempt to gain access to it.

Common methods include:
- Trying default credentials (e.g. admin/admin, admin/password)
- Brute-forcing login forms
- Exploiting weak or missing authentication controls

Gaining access to an admin panel can give an attacker elevated privileges over the application, making it a high-value target.

## The Role of an Ethical Hacker

Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers or white-hat hackers, are security professionals authorised to perform attacks on systems to identify weaknesses.

Key responsibilities include:
- Identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors do
- Documenting and reporting findings clearly
- Recommending fixes and improvements
- Operating strictly within an agreed scope

Ethical hacking is only legal when performed with explicit written permission from the system owner.

## Why This Matters

Offensive security skills are in high demand across the cyber security industry.

They are applied in roles such as:
- Penetration tester
- Red team operator
- Bug bounty hunter
- Security consultant
- Vulnerability researcher

Hands-on experience, even in a simulated environment, is one of the most effective ways to build offensive security skills.

## Reflection

This room provided a practical first look at offensive security by walking through the process of finding and exploiting a vulnerability in a simulated web application. It demonstrated how real-world attackers think and operate, and why understanding offensive techniques is essential for building effective defences.
